# Transformer-Based Sentiment Classification: Error Analysis & Failure Modes

Placeholder repository for analyzing systematic errors in transformer-based sentiment models.
Planned focus:

- Misclassifications under domain shift
- Ambiguous or mixed sentiment
- Linguistic patterns (negation, sarcasm, etc.)
- Evaluation beyond aggregate accuracy (e.g., stratified error analysis)
