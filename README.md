# Transformer-Based Sentiment Classification: Error Analysis and Failure Modes

This project explores **where and why transformer-based sentiment analysis models make mistakes**.

Instead of focusing only on overall accuracy, the goal is to analyze **systematic error patterns**, including:
- Sentences with negation (e.g., “not good”)
- Mixed or ambiguous sentiment
- Linguistic constructions such as contrast (“but”, “however”)
- Performance degradation under domain shift

The project is currently **under active development**.  
This repository serves as a foundation for experiments in error analysis, evaluation methodology, and model robustness.
